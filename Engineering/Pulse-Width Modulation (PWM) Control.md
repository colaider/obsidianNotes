Is a way to control output [[PWM]] using some input [[signal]] and carrier [[wave]].  Can be more explicitly a SPWM or [[sinus]]oidal PWM. 

Used in different [[power]] [[converter]]s or variable [[frequency]] drives for electric [[motor]]s. 

In such scenarios control is done through [[modulation]] index which is a [[duty cycle]] in this case.
