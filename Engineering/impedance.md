It is a combination of [[resistance]] and [[reactance]]

X(in ohms) is a reactance and comes from [[capacitor]] or [[inductor]] 

Capacitor are overcome reactance and it is how [[static var compensators]] work. 


If we have only R circuit we have current ant voltage in [[phase]] with one another. Because it is no reactance.

In phase:
