Is a type of [[total derivative]]. Shows how all variables change with respect to all other variables.  And its [[determinant]] shows how change of coordinate scale measures. 

The [[gradient]] vector is a special case of jacobian.

### Example 
Conversion from [[cartesian coordinates]] to [[polar coordinates]]

J is a derivative of each dimension in origin space to each dimension in final space.

But we have to have defined mapping 


### it is useful 

For transforming integral dimensions from one to another. But why?

Jacobian basically is a constant which scales coordinates to one another. But it is a [[matrices]] of derivatives. 

Before of this we have that y=dxdy/defter or 
d(x,y)/d(r,tet). And the last thing is to determine mapping equations.  Can be done for any [[coordinate transformation]]
