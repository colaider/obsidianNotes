Two make an average representation of a dc dc convertor with capacitor in parallel.  ![[Pasted image 20250606111741.png]]

Two make a convertor [[average representation]] without a [[capacitor]] we don't need to take a=energy from one source and transfer it into another place. We just have to multiply input by [[modulation index]].
