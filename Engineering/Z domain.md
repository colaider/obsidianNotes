[[Z domain]] is a [[math]]ematical domain which is widely used in [[control theory]] for [[function]] and [[signal]] discretisation.  

### Trapezoidal method (Tustin) 
Is a method of [[discretisation]] for [[s domain]] [[transfer function]] discretisation using: 

s=2/Ts⋅z−1/z+1

### Key properties: 

1. Linearity
2. Time shift 
3. Convolution in time is a multiplication in z
