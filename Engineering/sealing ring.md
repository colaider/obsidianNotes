### **1. Sealing Ring: Definition & Purpose**

A **sealing ring** (also called a **gasket** or **O-ring**) is a mechanical component designed to:

- **Prevent leaks** of fluids (liquids/gases) between two connected parts.
    
- **Block contamination** (dust, debris) from entering a system.
    
- **Maintain pressure/vacuum** integrity in sealed systems.

For fluids -> rubber rings

### How to use ring

Not used to fix [[bearing]]s on [[shaft]], but to prevent fluid leaks.

But for fixating things in place it is another component called [[retaining ring]]
