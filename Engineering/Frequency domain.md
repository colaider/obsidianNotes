This image shows what [[frequency]] domain exactly is and how it is related to [[time domain ]]

### Frequency domain graph 

frequency-domain graphÂ shows how much of the [[signal]] lies within each given frequency band over a range of frequencies.

This kind of graph shows all frequencies and their amplitude so sine [[wave]]s from which resulted signal composed through [[Fourier transformation]]
