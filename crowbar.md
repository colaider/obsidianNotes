I ana [[electrical]] safety component, that breaks a power supply line if voltage or/and exceeds some limit.

The Simulation principle:

If voltage more ta 5k than open contactor and send fault signal

### Can be build as bidirectional [[diode]] clamp

Two opposite connected parallel diodes resistor an [[inductor]]
Shortly diodes have a range and voltage not exceed this range anther it will be clamped
