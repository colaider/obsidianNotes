Units coulomb 
One [[electron]] has 1.6e-19 coulombs 

#### properties 
1. Charge is conserved (cannot be destroyed or created)
2. Cam move from but only with a holder of charge 
3. Creates [[electrical field]] and when charges move they create [[magnetic field]]


#### some formulas 
Coulombâ€™s law:
