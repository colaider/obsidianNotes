Can be [[froward kinematics]] and [[inverse kinematics]].
Froward one is for determining a position of a [[manipulator]] and inverse is to set this position.

### [[velocity kinematics]]

Is kinematics which helps to determine a [[angular velocitie]]s of joints in order to keep desired velocity of [[end effector]]

J is [[jacobian]] [[matrix]] which in this case determines kinematics of manipulator.
