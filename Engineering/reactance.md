#electronics 

It is [[imaginary]]  or complex a part of [[impedance]]
(expressed through [[complex number]]s)

Occurs in [[capacitor]] and [[inductor]]

#### Inductive reactance: X = 2pi*f*L
So it is dependent on [[frequency]] 

##### About [[phase]]
Current lags behind voltage

#### Capacitive reactance: X 1/2pi*f*C
Dependant on frequency as well 

About [[phase]]
Current leads voltage So [[phase angle]] can be compensated. 


### In [[complex plane]]

Z=R+*j*X

#### Inductive reactance 
X>0 adds positive imaginary component 

#### Capacitive reactance 
X<0 adds negative imaginary component 


### Phase angle

Phase angle can be found as a normal angle in [[polar coordinates]] representation of a complex number. And this is:
