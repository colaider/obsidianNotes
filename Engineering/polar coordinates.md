Alternative to [[cartesian coordinates]] 

Origin in polar is [[pole]] it is a fixed point.
Angle usually with x is polar axis.

### Coordinate mapping

A single point may have many polar representations, e.g., (1, 0), (1, 2\pi), and (-1,\pi) all describe the same point. 

Which leads us to [[Reimann surface]]s. In [[complex plane]] 

### Is any [[matrices]] here 

We can use [[rotation matrices]] and scaling in Cartesian and then transform back 

#### As well can be similar to [[spherical coordinates]] 3-D polar coordinates
